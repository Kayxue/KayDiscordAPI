# KayDiscordAPI

**Warning! this package is still in development!**

## Why I want to make this package
Because I like new usage of Discord.js v12, and also thinks that some Discord.js v13 usages are good. So I want to write a package which combined Discord.js V12 and later version good usages, and also make a good command handler for TypeScript users. Also, I want to practice my Typescript skills
